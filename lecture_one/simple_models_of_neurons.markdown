# Simple models of Neurons

Idealized neurons
- Model things we have to idealize them
	- removes complicated details that are not essential for understanding the main principles
	- It allows us to apply mathematics and to make analogies to other, familiar systems
	- Once we understand the basic principles, its easy to add complexity to make model for faithful

## Linear Neurons

Simple but computationally limited
